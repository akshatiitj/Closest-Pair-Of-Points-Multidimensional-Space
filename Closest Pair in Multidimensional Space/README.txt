Closest Pair in Multidimensional Space
======================================

Details:
1. The main file "closest_pair.py" takes input from "input.txt" which contains 4,000,000 random integers ranging from (-10,000 to 10,000).
2. 1,000,000 numbers in 4 dimensions are printed in a file "collection.txt".
3. The minimum distance between a pair of points is printed in a file "output.txt".
4. The time complexity is O(n*Logn).

Requirements:
Python2.7

Steps to compile the project:
1. Keep the files "closest_pair.py", "sort.py", "read_write.py" and "input.txt" in same folder.
2. Execute "closest_pair.py" to get "output.txt".
